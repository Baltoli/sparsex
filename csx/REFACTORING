* [DONE] RowBegin()/RowEnd() should be replaced by the SparsePartition::iterator
* [DONE] Replace all instances of Elem/CooElem/RLEs with the Element
* [DONE] Revisit statistics collecting mechanism
  -- Stats structure, element markers (new heur)
* Revisit pattern-id assigning mechanism
* Revisit namespace csx (should become sparsex, probably)
* Eliminate unused/dead code, incl. commented out code
* [ 50%] Clean up thgoud code
* Revisit SparsePartition building, especially SetElems()
* Remove the emacs directive from header files
* Heuristic selection could be an spx option
* Consider making SparsePartition::iterator a const iterator
* Treat zero-sized windows
* Block alignment -> fixed dim vs. variable dim
* Cbegin() -> cbegin()
* Revisit PreparePat()'s arguments
* Check FIXME tags
* Remove std:: prefixes where possible
* Revise iterators (Mmf, Csr, SparsePartition)
* Consider zero-based indexing for Element
* Clean the interfaces, one- or zero-based, decide!
* Replace Print() methods with friend operator<<()'s
* Consider implementing operator->() in iterators
* Gather all general utilities (iceil, gcd, check_iterator) in a single file
* Advanced type checking with type traits
* Unsigned to signed conversions
* Remove `inline' keyword and move member function definitions inside the class
  (SparseMatrix.hpp)
* Xs -> Cols
* [DONE] Rethink element marking mechanism
* valgrind check / memory leaks
* DEBUG_MODE compilation macro
* Clarify the use of nr_rows_ of SparsePartition and rowptr_size_
* Remove default arguments or document precisely
* [DONE] Fix Diag <-> AntiDiag conversions
* Use auto variables instead of heap allocated if their scope is limited inside
  a function
* Verify that MemoryAllocator::Reallocate follows the realloc(3) contract
* Code replication
