1. INTRODUCTION
===============

The SparseX library is a collection of low-level primitives written in the 
C/C++ programming languages, that provides the means to developers of solver 
libraries and of scientific and engineering applications to easily attain high 
performance of the Sparse Matrix-by-Vector multiplication kernel (SpMV) on 
modern multicore architectures.

The SparseX package uses the Compressed Sparse eXtended format for sparse 
matrices. This format seeks to minimize the memory footprint of the 
column index array of the typical Compressed Sparse Row (CSR) format by 
exploiting dense substructures inside the sparse matrix. Instead of storing 
a single index for every nonzero element of the sparse matrix, CSX stores a 
short description for each substructure found in the matrix (and selected for 
encoding). This technique can save significant amount of main memory storage 
and minimize the bandwidth requirements of the Sparse Matrix-Vector
Multiplication (SpMV) kernel. Finally, the CSX format employs runtime
code generation (using the LLVM compiler infrastructure) for emitting
optimized SpMV routines for each encoded pattern.

More information about the CSX format can be found in:

2. REQUIREMENTS
===============

* A fairly recent Linux OS
* LLVM >= 3.0 and Clang
* Boost Library >= 1.48 (regex, serialization, system, thread)
* numactl library >= 2.0.7
* gcc/g++ >= 4.6

3. INSTALLATION
===============

To get the latest version of the SparseX library, you can

Option 1: visit https://github.com/cslab-ntua/sparsex and download a tarball 
          of the latest release

Option 2: clone the git repository by typing
          $ git clone git://github.com/cslab-ntua/sparsex.git

The simplest way to compile this package is:

    1. If the library has been downloaded in means of cloning the git 
       repository or downloading the tarball available on the github link, 
       you must first run:

       $ autoreconf -vfi

       in order to remake all of the configure scripts.

    2. ‘cd’ to the directory containing the package’s source code and type
       ‘./configure’ to configure the package for your system.
       If you have installed LLVM/Clang in a non-standard location that is 
       not in your path, you can instruct the compilation process to use your 
       preferred LLVM installation through the ‘--with-llvm’ configuration 
       option (by providing the absolute path to the LLVM configuration script 
       “llvm-config”). Similarly for the Boost library you can use the 
       ‘--with-boostdir’ option.

       $ cd SPARSEX_DIR
       $ ./configure [options]

    3. Type ‘make’ to compile the package. 
       You can speed up the compilation by using multiple tasks with the ‘-j’ 
       flag of make:

       $ make -j8

    4. Type ‘make install’ to install the library and any data files and 
       documentation.
       When installing into a prefix owned by root, it is recommended that the
       package be configured and built as a regular user, and only the 
       ‘make install’ phase executed with root privileges. By default, 
       ‘make install’ installs the library under /usr/local/lib and include 
       files under /usr/local/include. You can specify an installation prefix 
       other than /usr/local by giving ‘configure’ in step 1 the option 
       ‘--prefix=PREFIX’, where PREFIX must be an absolute directory path.

       $ make install

See INSTALL for more details on the installation process and the available 
options and also refer to the library's User's Guide.

==========
4. TESTING
==========

The test/src subdirectory of the installation directory includes a testing 
utility 'test_sparsex' for the SparseX library. This is not installed by 
default and requires you to type 'make check' in test/src/. This executable
tests different aspects of the library and is important for verifying that the
library works properly on your system. To facilitate the testing process, the 
'test-sparsex.sh' script is available in the test/scripts subdirectory. Simply 
type:

        $ ./test/scripts/test-sparsex.sh 

from the top level of the build directory and a number of tests will be
performed with their progress (PASSED or FAILED) printed on stdout.

Common pitfalls:
 * In case the library has been installed in a non-standard location, you must
   explicitly add the library directory to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment 
   variable before execution, e.g.

   $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$(LIBDIR):$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
