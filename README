MT_CONF - Determine the sequence of the cpus used to run 'spmv'.
          e.g Suppose the desired cpus are cpu0 and cpu2. In order to run 'spmv'
          with this selection, it must be typed
                          MT_CONF=0,2 ./spmv ...
          Default Value : 0

XFORM_COMF - Determine the types of patterns, which are desired by the user,
             used in the process of encoding the matrix. The mapping between
             numbers and types is the following:
                           0 -> NONE
                           1 -> HORIZONTAL
                           2 -> VERTICAL
                           3 -> DIAGONAL
                           4 -> REV_DIAGONAL
                           5 -> BLOCK_TYPE_START (not used)
                           6 -> BLOCK_R1 (not used)
                           7 -> BLOCK_R2
                           8 -> BLOCK_R3
                           9 -> BLOCK_R4
                          10 -> BLOCK_R5
                          11 -> BLOCK_R6
                          12 -> BLOCK_R7
                          13 -> BLOCK_R8
                          14 -> BLOCK_COL_START (not used)
                          15 -> BLOCK_C1 (not used)
                          16 -> BLOCK_C2
                          17 -> BLOCK_C3
                          18 -> BLOCK_C4
                          19 -> BLOCK_C5
                          20 -> BLOCK_C6
                          21 -> BLOCK_C7
                          22 -> BLOCK_C8
                          23 -> BLOCK_TYPE_END (not used)
                          24 -> XFORM_MAX
             e.g If HORIZONTAL and BLOCK_C2 types are destined to be included in
             the process of encoding, it must be typed
                          XFORM_CONF=2,16 ./spmv ...
             In case that ENCODE_DELTAS are determined as well. the order of
             encoding is the same as the order typed in terminal.
             Default Value : 0

ENCODE_DELTAS - Determine the deltas for 1-4 types and the second dimensions of
                7-13 and 16-22 block types which will be used in the encoding
                process. If this value is determined, no statistical data is
                taken from the matrix and encoding process is done as ordered by
                the XFORM_CONF option.
                e.g If the following is typed
                     XFORM_CONF=16,1,3 ENCODE_DELTAS={4,7},{1},{11} ./spmv ...
                the matrix will be encoded firstly with 'BLOCK_C2' patterns with
                second dimensions 4 and 7 (block 4x2 and 7x2), secondly with 
                'HORIZONTAL' patterns with delta 1 and finally with 'DIAGONAL'
                patterns with delta 11.
                Default Value : -
                Prerequisites : XFORM_CONF option determined,
                                same length as XFORM_CONF.

SPLIT_BLOCKS - If determined (with any value) activates the 'split blocks'
               function and leads to better usage of block patterns in matrix.
               This option does not operate ideally when used with sampling.
               e.g If the following is typed
                                  SPLIT_BLOCKS=1 ./spmv ...
               the block patterns will be supported by 'split_blocks' function.
               Default Value : -
               Not compatible : WINDOW_SIZE, SAMPLINGS, SAMPLING_PROB
