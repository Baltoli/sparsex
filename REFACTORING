* [DONE] RowBegin()/RowEnd() should be replaced by the SparsePartition::iterator
* [DONE] Replace all instances of Elem/CooElem/RLEs with the Element
* [DONE] Revisit statistics collecting mechanism
  -- Stats structure, element markers (new heur)
* [DONE] Revisit namespace csx (should become sparsex, probably)
* [DONE] Remove the emacs directive from header files
* [DONE] Heuristic selection could be an spx option
* [DONE] Block alignment -> fixed dim vs. variable dim
* [DONE] Cbegin() -> cbegin()
* [DONE] Revisit PreparePat()'s arguments
* [DONE] Remove std:: prefixes where possible
* [DONE] Clean the interfaces, one- or zero-based, decide! -> core library uses
         one-base indexing everywhere, api provides both
* [DONE] Replace Print() methods with friend operator<<()'s
* [DONE] Gather all general utilities (iceil, gcd, check_iterator) in a single
  file
* [DONE] Advanced type checking with type traits
* [DONE] Unsigned to signed conversions
* [DONE] Remove `inline' keyword and move member function definitions inside the
  class (SparseMatrix.hpp)
* [DONE] Xs -> Cols
* [DONE] Rethink element marking mechanism
* [DONE] DEBUG_MODE compilation macro
* [DONE] Fix Diag <-> AntiDiag conversions
* [DONE] Verify that MemoryAllocator::Reallocate follows the realloc(3) contract
* [DONE] max_rowptr_size_ is never used.
* [DONE] Use -Wextra? Lots of warnings of unused function parameters
* [DONE] Eliminate all -Wall warnings (debug version)
* [DONE] Add the SPARSEX_ or SPARSEX_INTERNALS_ prefix to double inclusion
  defines in header files
* [DONE] Staged SPX_JIT_INCLUDE/SPX_MULT_TEMPLATE_DIR should use absolute paths
* [DONE] Use SPX_ prefix in macros, e.g., DEBUG_MODE -> SPX_DEBUG
* [DONE] DisableInfo() is counter-intuitive (why not EnableXXX()??)
* [DONE] (Re)move unnecessary includes from header files
* [DONE] Change "" to <> for sparsex-related includes
* [DONE] Fix error when invoking test_sparsex without arguments
* [DONE] Fix warnings when compiling with -DDISABLE_POOL
* [DONE] Fix 80-column layout
* [DONE] Treat timings output and all info not yet passed through the logger somehow
* [DONE] ADD SPX prefix to INVALID_MAT...
* [DONE] Add and fix copyright headers to all source files
* [90%] Eliminate unused/dead code, incl. commented out code
* [50%] Check FIXME tags
* [50%] Clean up thgoud code
* [50%] Segfault when TemplateText placeholders are empty/not found. Print
  error and inform about installation.
* [50%] Use auto variables instead of heap allocated if their scope is limited
  inside a function
* [] Clarify the use of nr_rows_ of SparsePartition and rowptr_size_
* [] Remove default arguments or document precisely
* [] Update README
* When _GLIBCXX_DEBUG is defined, error in debug mode compilation
* Always leave space after end of code block and next statement
* Valgrind check / memory leaks
* Code replication
* Revisit pattern-id assigning mechanism
* Consider implementing operator->() in iterators
* Revise iterators (Mmf, Csr, SparsePartition)
* Consider zero-based indexing for Element
* Vector should become proper C++
* Revisit SparsePartition building, especially SetElems()
* Consider making SparsePartition::iterator a const iterator
