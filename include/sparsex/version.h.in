 * SPARSEX_VERSION =
 *      100000*MAJOR_VERSION + 1000*MINOR_VERSION + PATCH_LEVEL
 *
 * Inversely, the major/minor versions and the patch level of the package can be
 * computed as follows:
 *
 * MAJOR_VERSION = SPARSEX_VERSION / 100000     <br>
 * MINOR_VERSION = SPARSEX_VERSION / 1000 % 100 <br>
 * PATCH_LEVEL   = SPARSEX_VERSION % 1000       <br>
